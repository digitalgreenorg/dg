					<dt id="7_1">
						What are data inconsistencies?
					</dt>
					<dd>
						In the past, we noticed some errors in the database due to human errors. We are trying to catch these errors and notify user about the errors using Data Inconsistencies. For example, sometimes the Video Production start data maybe after the Video Production end date. This is clearly an error in data entry. Another example is when a video takes more than 12 days to produce. Most of our videos are produced in well under that time and this may well be a data entry error. Therefore, this is flagged for the Field Officer's attention.
					</dd>
					<dt id="7_2">
						How do I resolve them?
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<ul>
							<li>Review the message in the Error Msg column.
							</li>
							<li>Click on the reference objects in the Object 1 and Object 2 columns and edit these appropriately.
							</li>
							<li>Return to the Data Inconsistencies page and check the box in the "Not an Error" column.
							</li>
							<li>Click "Save" at the bottom of the page.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</dd>
					<dt id="7_3">
						What is "Not an Error"?
					</dt>
					<dd>
						The Data Inconsistencies page is a tool for identifying and correcting errors. We identify errors based on simple logic and general trends. For example, most videos are produced in under twelve days and if a video takes more than twelve days to produce it is possible that this data was entered in error and the video actually took a shorter time to produce. However, some videos may as well take more than twelve days to produce. In this case, this data was not entered by mistake and is a valid and correct data entry. In such cases, we recommend that you mark these as "Not an Error" and click "Save".
					</dd>
					<dt id="7_4">
						I resolved an error, but the number of data inconsistencies is still same. Why?
					</dt>
					<dd>
						Corrected data inconsistencies are removed every 24 hours. Please check after some time.
					</dd>
					<dt id="7_5">
						How do I rectify the error if it says "This screening has video from other state, compared to the state of screening. This might be potentially wrong."? I don't understand what it means.
					</dt>
					<dd>
						Sometime, a user enters creates a screening which has video from other state. Sometimes, this is a valid case but most of times this is an error because videos are usually produced in local languages. Please click on the screening and review the Video selected.

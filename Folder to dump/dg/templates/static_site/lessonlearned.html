    		<span class='subheaders'> Organizational Development </span> <br/>
			Digital Green's team members were recruited from a variety of backgrounds, including experienced managers from large non-profits to new graduates whose first job is with Digital Green.  We have focused on staff and organizational development through numerous initiatives like orientation programs, and retreats.  We found that immersing new employees in the rural context is successful means for talent recruitment and development. We launched our first internship program with six individuals; two joined the team as full-time team members upon its completion.  The initial learning and planning phase represented not only an opportunity for our organization to learn and plan, but also for our team members to understand the rural context, our partners' existing interventions, and the technology and social layers that Digital Green builds upon these foundations.  We experienced some fragmentation in team cohesion while individual team members were embedded within the field offices of our partners; however, as our team developed, we were able to transition to regional offices to allow for greater knowledge sharing and camaraderie within the organization while also providing the type of training and support that our partners needed.
			<br/><br/>
			<span class='subheaders'> Partnership  </span> <br/>
			Digital Green began under the auspices of a research project, and many of our partners were introduced to Digital Green as a pilot.  This provided opportunities to partner with large, well-established organizations, like PRADAN and BAIF.  At the same time, this approach limited the ownership that these organizations had over the system and its outcomes.  This perception was furthered with our team members embedded in our partners' locations.  Consequently, we revised our partnership approach with our new and earlier collaborators through a structured competitive process.  Using a request for applications process, we were able to identify those partners that had the motivation and ability to integrate their existing agricultural extension system with Digital Green.  Informal agreements were replaced with formal ones that clearly defined milestones, timelines, and roles and responsibilities.  In addition, Digital Green assumed a role, reflecting its core competencies, as a technology development and support provider.  
			<br/><br/>
			<span class='subheaders'> Quality Assurance  </span> <br/>
			Digital Green works in a variety of different geographies with a diversity of partners and community members.  We drafted and iterated standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the key processes that define our system. We also established an internal control system to that includes procedures for using these SOPs to perform internal audits and to certify our interventions.  
			<br/><br/>
			For instance, we have focused on ensuring the agronomic accuracy and completeness of the techniques featured in the videos.  We initially tried to involve state-level experts from our partner staff as well as State Agricultural Universities; however, the videos were often incomprehensible to these experts because of local language diversity and context-specific agro ecological considerations.  To also reduce the logistical bottleneck associated with this process, each partner now maintains a documented process on reviewing and approving content prior to its distribution by subject-matter experts at the district-level.  These experts are now involved at the initial stages of the video production process, which includes topic identification and storyboarding, prior to the video being shot.  The introduction of these processes has reduced the rate of videos that are rejected from 35% in November 2009 to 20% in August 2010.  In the next phase, we will establish a scientific review board to sample a set of videos to provide third-party assessments of the technical and aesthetic qualities of the videos from across our operational areas.
			<br/><br/>
			The capabilities of those involved in the Digital Green system from our own team to partner staff to community intermediaries have developed over time, and we are progressively introducing more sophisticated, creative processes into the ecosystem.  For example, we recently initiated trials of the Sabido Methodology to introduce dramatic elements into the videos to win over audiences while imparting agricultural knowledge.  We have also found that the inclusion of text- and audio-based annotations in the videos can assist facilitators in mediating screenings more effectively.
			<br/><br/>
			<span class='subheaders'> Sustainability  </span> <br/>
			Digital Green works with organizations that operate existing agricultural extension systems to ensure that its program will continue as its system is institutionalized. We have also found that it critical to emphasize the community's involvement in all aspects of the system.  It is vital, for instance, for the community to be able to share feedback on its needs and interests for the videos that are produced and screened.  As another example, the community must also be involved in identifying those individuals from the community who will be responsible for mediating video disseminations.  We found that financial contributions from the community toward the recurring costs of the system could be met when packaged with existing services.  A ticket-based payment mode, for example, in which individuals paid INR 2-4 to attend a screening resulted in farmers wanting to increase the number of videos that were shown in a single screening.  
			<br/><br/>
			The community's ability to pay for agricultural extension services largely depends on a partners' ability to have demonstrated value in their past interventions and to have transitioned to a fee-based model in their existing programs.  Our partners are at various stages of making this transition, which is especially a challenge in areas where fully subsidized interventions have been used in the past.  We initially would share the concept of the Digital Green system with the community at higher-level institutions, like farmer federations or panchayats, which are comprised of representatives of grassroots-level groups, like Self Help Groups.  We found that commitments made on behalf of their group were often ineffectively passed on to the group-level.  Since it is infeasible for us to meet one-on-one with the over thousand groups that are already participating with Digital Green, our partners now meet in person with higher-level groups and share videos with grassroots-level groups to discuss the concept of the Digital Green system and its relation with our partners and the community.
			<br/><br/>
			<span class='subheaders'> Technology  </span> <br/>
			Digital Green began as a research pilot four years ago using video cameras that cost US$ 2,000 per unit to capture videos and televisions, DVD players, and batteries that cost US$ 500 per set to disseminate videos.  Over the years, this equipment has become increasingly commoditized and costs have plummeted.  At the same time, we began to extend the Digital Green system into increasingly remote areas of rural India which are disconnected from the electricity grid and in which population densities are lower.  The equipment used to disseminate videos rotates amongst the farmer groups in a village that share it and we found that it was too bulky to transport by hand.  
			<br/><br/>
			We experimented with using a tricycle rickshaw, but even pedaling could not be sustained in areas with hilly terrain and poor road infrastructure.  We consequently investigated various alternative technology platforms and found that pocket video cameras to capture videos and pico projectors to disseminate videos were well suited for the environments in which we operate.  Pocket video cameras cost about US$ 120 per unit and capture high-definition (1080p) video and have memory card slots as well as connectors for tripods and external wireless microphones, which enhance picture and sound quality.  Pico projectors cost about US$ 150 per unit and in a less-than-one-kilogram, compact form have remote controls, ninety-minutes of battery backup, memory card slots for playing a library of videos, and audio output for enhanced sound and volume from external speakers.  Our team works closely with our partners on the optimal usage of these devices, like maintaining small audiences in dimly lit rooms to best view projections from the pico projector, and to define logistics for charging, storing, and maintaining the devices.  We have evaluated several different video cameras and pico projectors in the field and have consulted advisors, like One Media Player Per Teacher, and distributors, such as Sima Products, as well.

			<span class='subheaders'> Feedback Mechanisms    </span> <br/>
			Community members largely share their feedback with community intermediaries at the time of video disseminations, who record their needs and interests on paper forms, which are later digitized onto Digital Green's COCO data management framework and periodically analyzed.  Topics that a partner may not have even considered earlier, such as new crops or disease incidences, have often been identified through this approach, but there typically is a lag of 10-15 days between when a farmer voices an issue and when it results in a response in the form of a new video or training program.  To mitigate these delays, especially for time-sensitive concerns, we worked with researchers from Stanford University and University of California, Berkeley to deploy an interactive voice response (IVR) question-and-answer system based on the work of the Avaaj Otalo project.  Though the IVR system is available to anyone via a toll-free number, it primarily aims to support the community intermediaries involved in video production and dissemination.  The IVR system is moderated by the local subject-matter experts of our partners and allows users to asynchronously record queries and to receive responses from an appropriate specialist.  We are currently piloting this system at one district-level location in Madhya Pradesh and are looking to extend it going forward.  
			<br/><br/>
			Other researchers from University of Washington experimented with systems to maintain a log of the videos that were screened in villages using acoustic fingerprinting and custom-made remote controls.  We found that these pilots were interesting mechanisms for ensuring accountability, but were difficult to use in practice.

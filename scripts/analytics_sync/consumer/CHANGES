-- 1.6.1 GA --
Detect when the server_id is not set on the master and exit with error.  FlexCDC would silently fail previously.
Add options to change the names of the tables which FlexCDC uses to store metadata information.  
Add FlexSBR, which is a statement based replicator - this is an experimental feature and is not considered GA quality yet, so YMMV.
Added a script (add_table.php) which will allow you to add a changelog to a table



-- 1.6.0 RC3 --
NEW FEATURES:
added add_table.php which is used to add a table changelog to a table.  It simply calls FlexCDC::create_mvlog
table names are now configurable
the replication directory contains FlexSBR, which is a FlexCDC extension which executes SBR statements.

BUG FIXES:
SET statements are now executed
When changing log files, the delimiter was not reset to ;.  This has been fixed.
FlexCDC could ignore some errors from mysqlbinlog if a version 5.0 mysqlbinlog was in the path.  This would result in a loop with an error message continually being displayed.  All mysqlbinlog errors are now detected.

;the following three tables store the metadata information for FlexCDC including at which binary log file/position to which binary logs have been processed. You MUST NOT include database names on these tables.  They will all be placed into the database specified above.  If you are using flexcdc for something OTHER THAN FLEXVIEWS then you can remap the table names which FlexCDC uses to alternative names.  DO NOT CHANGE THESE VALUES IF YOU ARE USING FLEXVIEWS or if you don't have a very good reason to change them.

;Automatically create changelog tables and enable changelogging for ALL tables.
;You might not want to use this option if any of the following is true:
;  you have lots of tables
;  you drop and create tables with the same name
;  you are using flexviews
;  you have tables which you do not need to capture changes from

;If you choose not to use the auto_changelog feature, then you can use add_table.php to create changelogs
;or you can use the flexviews.create_mvlog function in ../proc/create_mvlog.sql
auto_changelog=false

;If you set raise_warnings=true then when Flexviews sees an unsupported command (like DROP) it raises a warning to
;stdout.  You might want to use the 'logger' utility to capture the output if you turn this on

;Bulk insertion inserts all changes in a transaction as one big INSERT statement.

;The next two variables control the amount of time that FlexCDC spends sleeping between invocations of mysqlbinlog.
;In order to avoid putting excessive load on the master, FlexCDC progressively backs off when it detects no changes
;from the master.  By default it will back off in increments of .25 seconds up to five seconds, at which point it
;will no longer increase the wait time any more.  The downside of this setting is that it can make incremental 
;refresh slower because the refresh process may have to wait for FlexCDC to wake and and process the changes that it
;recently committed.

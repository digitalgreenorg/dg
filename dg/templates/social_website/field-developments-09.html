                            	Model partnering is central to our ability to successfully achieve our objectives. We not only aim to enable our partners to deliver on Digital Green's technical package, but also to build institutionally strong and empowered partners that will continue building the system even after the project duration ends. We consequently had to develop short- and long-term strategies with each of our partners, each of which are diverse and heterogeneous organizations. Digital Green's role then is essentially to raise the technical capacity of our partners and then provide supportive supervision. A national-level workshop with all of our partners and several state-level workshops have been held to orient partners on the Digital Green system and its technology platform. Some of the specific training sessions have covered topics including: (1) video production and dissemination, (2) standard operating procedures and mechanisms for quality assurance and internal audit, (3) institution guidelines for partners to prepare and submit implementation proposals and budgets, and (4) data validation and management using the COCO framework.

                            	As we scale the Digital Green system, quality assurance has become increasing challenging and critical. We have developed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to provide a framework for the end-to-end Digital Green system to ensure consistency in operational processes and outcomes: from best practices in sharing the concept of Digital Green with a community to video production and dissemination to capturing and analyzing the community's feedback. The SOPs initially served as reference guides for Digital Green team members involved in executing project activities. As the organization's role evolved, the SOPs were reworked and translated so that they could be used by our partners directly. The SOPs are publically accessible via our website: http://www.digitalgreen.org/sop/ .

                            	The SOPs have played an important role in ensuring quality in our operations. We have instituted an internal control system to audit and certify our interventions based on the SOPs. This includes a checklist-based review at regional meetings on a monthly basis on 21 priorities areas that we have identified as crucial to assuring consistent and successful outcomes. In the next year, we intend to transform our written SOPs into a video-based curriculum for broader accessibility.

                            	Data is central to our ability to achieve the qualitative and quantitative outputs and outcomes that we seek. Through the Agricultural Technology Adoption Initiative (ATAI), researchers from the University of California, Berkeley and Yale University initiated consultations and field visits in preparation to define metrics and to design protocols for a large- scale randomized controlled trial evaluation of the Digital Green system in comparison to the traditional extension approaches practiced by our partners.

                            	To support these efforts, our systems engineering team developed an open-source enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, called COCO (Connect Online, Connect Offline) to manage and support our operations teams' activities across India. The Analytics suite of dashboards that serves as the front-end of our monitoring and evaluation framework is accessible at: http://analytics.digitalgreen.org. These dashboards give rich, near real-time insight to our work in the field on time-, geographic, and partner-specific dimensions. The dashboard allows us to better sort through our growing library of videos, target interventions based on historical trends, and allows for data exchange among our partners and team members who often operate in areas with limited or no Internet connectivity.

                            	Partner staff members and community intermediaries at block- and district-levels input data into this system. Digital Green and partner staff members use control mechanisms to review and verify the accuracy of inputted data through cross-validation of reports as well as random sample inspections in the field. We have observed that the transparency of our data management framework creates a positive tension amongst the partners that motivates them to ensure the accuracy of the inputted data as well as to do well with respect to their peers.

                            	We developed an internal control system to certify villages in which the Digital Green system has been operationalized using the framework of our standard operating procedures. Since we work with a variety of partners across a diversity of locations, the aim of these internal audits is not to find faults with our partners or team members, but rather, to identify ways in which we can better target our intervention as well as to capture learnings that might improve the SOPs. These reviews are conducted by Digital Green team members not directly associated with the area in which it is performed. At the community-level, three types of metrics are used: (1) logical parameters to measure compliance to SOPs; (2) quantitative parameters to measure cost effectiveness; and (3) qualitative parameters to measure community empowerment. At the district-level, the processes and outputs of video production are also certified.

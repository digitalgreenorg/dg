                            <p class="copy-para">A data management framework, COCO, forms the foundation of our technology stack. COCO captures data related to key processes of our model: video production (e.g., practices featured, farmers involved, seasonality), dissemination (e.g., videos screened, attendance, interests expressed, questions), and adoption of practices (e.g., components of practices physically observed on farm, regularity of uptake).
                            </p>
                            <p>COCO's singular feature is its ability to operate offline in low and limited bandwidth locations, with uninterrupted usage in the browser. The application is designed to support up to 100,000 users located anywhere in the world and requires Internet connectivity only when a user is ready to synchronize their data with our global repository. Built as a robust standalone application in the Internet browser, COCO requires no additional software installation or maintenance.

The application highlights the integrated nature of the practices that individual farmers adopt on their fields as well as stimulates healthy competition among partners, village facilitators, and community members through the sharing of performance data and community feedback. Use of Farmerbook also supports transparency and accountability in existing extension systems and enables the development of non-monetary incentive structures among stakeholders participating in them through mechanisms like leaderboards.

                            <p class="copy-para">To see how our core work in the field can connect with external audiences who could learn and engage in issues related to rural development, we have created a social game, Wonder Village, which is hosted on Facebook. Through the game, players set up a simulated village economy and have opportunities to relate with actual farmers in the field. Players are placed in a resource-constrained setting and pursue quests like setting up small farms of paddy and maize and supplying raw materials to farmers' markets. The game follows a "freemium" model, which allows users to play for free and allows users to purchase virtual currency to advance more quickly.
                            </p>
                            <p>With over 80 million users playing games on Facebook every month for an average of 15 minutes a day, Wonder Village has the potential to be an effective awareness-building and fundraising tool for the development sector.

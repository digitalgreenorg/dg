                                Loop is a result of Digital Green’s foray into agriculture output markets focused on streamlining market linkages to increase income of smallholder farmers. Digital Green leverages its grassroots-level partnerships and strong technology know-how to address the specific problem most farmers face every day: how to sell their produce as quickly as possible at the best possible price. Reducing the problem to one of optimization of the aggregation, transport and marketing of vegetables helped build a sustainable solution in an ongoing pilot in Bihar, India.
                            <br><br>
                                A comprehensive technology stack comprising of an android application for transaction entry and accounting, SMS receipts, near real-time analytics dashboards, and IVR grievance redressal line increase transparency and enable remote monitoring of operations. In the process, we create a feedback loop to inform market driven content for our video-enabled extension approach, building marketing skills for village-level aggregators and enabling farmers to make more informed decisions.
                            <br><br>
                                Loop is now entering a phase of rapid expansion in Bihar, striving to move farmers from cash to digital payments, increasing sustainability through farmer and trader contribution, and scoping other geographies and commodities to adapt Loop for impact at scale.

                                Digital Green is building hybrid training courses for community knowledge workers, that are human mediated and include both offline and online components, to improve the manner in which their capacity is built to better engage farmers in their communities. This training curriculum combines practical instructional videos and a mobile training application that guides trainers and assesses the mastery level of workers.

                                The <a href="/training/courseware/" target="_blank"> training courseware</a>(available in Hindi, English and French) currently comprises of courses on (1) video dissemination using mobile pico projectors for community workers to become effective facilitators (2) video production to enable community teams to produce compelling videos featuring local farmers on relevant improved agricultural practices that boost farm productivity.

                                We are now producing benchmark curricula on agriculture package of practices. These benchmark videos aim to both improve the consistency of messaging while simultaneously building the technical capacity of workers themselves. With growing penetration of smartphones and internet connectivity, we also continue to explore mobile-based courseware that will enable community workers and farmers to self-service their learning.

The application highlights the integrated nature of the practices that individual farmers adopt on their fields as well as stimulates healthy competition among partners, village facilitators, and community members through the sharing of performance data and community feedback. Use of Farmerbook also supports transparency and accountability in existing extension systems and enables the development of non-monetary incentive structures among stakeholders participating in them through mechanisms like leaderboards.

                            <p class="copy-para">To see how our core work in the field can connect with external audiences who could learn and engage in issues related to rural development, we have created a social game, Wonder Village, which is hosted on Facebook. Through the game, players set up a simulated village economy and have opportunities to relate with actual farmers in the field. Players are placed in a resource-constrained setting and pursue quests like setting up small farms of paddy and maize and supplying raw materials to farmers' markets. The game follows a "freemium" model, which allows users to play for free and allows users to purchase virtual currency to advance more quickly.

                            <p class="copy-para">With over 80 million users playing games on Facebook every month for an average of 15 minutes a day, Wonder Village has the potential to be an effective awareness-building and fundraising tool for the development sector.

                            <p class="copy copy-para">We work with existing, people-based extension systems, aiming to amplify their effectiveness through our ICT-enabled approach. Our model combines technology and social organization to maximize the potential of building the capacity of community members on improved, sustainable agriculture, livelihood and health interventions.

                            <p class="copy copy-para">We also facilitate knowledge exchange between community engagement for partners looking to learn, contribute and connect on social innovation practices toward improving lives in rural communities. We work with partners throughout the entire experience to share knowledge and capture feedback with supported technologies that allow partners to locally produce and share videos in villages all around the world.

                            <h3 class="hdg-source-semibold hdg-c hdg-black layout-vr-sm">Key Principles</h3>
                            <p class="copy">The key principles driving our work are:</p>
                            <ul class="copy bullet-list">
                                <li>Partnership: Our focus is primarily on developing and delivering digital content to improve the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of organizations involved in agricultural and 	livelihood research and/or extension.
                                </li>
                                <li>Community ownership: Our goal is the adoption of our knowledge exchange model by communities for their improved well-being. By enabling them to be content producers and consumers, we empower communities to have a voice.
                                </li>
                                <li>Multi-layered content production and consumption: Our model facilitates knowledge exchange between institutional researchers, community-level organizations, and community members, thus linking smallholder issues with broader development conversations.
                                </li>
                                <li>Localization: A human-centered and contextual design approach remains at the core of our work, which helps us in successfully customizing our approach to suit diverse contexts and stakeholders.
                                </li>
                                <li>Cost realism: We often operate in environments with limited infrastructure and financial resources, which entails paying attention to costs at all levels, and limiting the investment in expensive equipment. 
                                </li>
                                <li>Mediation: Videotaped demonstrations per se are not a complete extension solution since they lack the interactivity expected of good extension. Our approach relies on a local facilitator, who occasionally pauses or repeats video to engage the audience with discussion and capture feedback.
                                </li>
                                <li>Training: We build the capacity of our partners, extension staff, and village facilitators in the social aspects of our approach for effective delivery of key messages.
                                </li>
                                <li>Gender: Targets for participation of women in the intervention, for instance as local facilitators, are determined and tracked. Particular attention is paid to the gender balance in recruiting women for video production. Topics of relevance to women are included in the content, especially topics related to crops grown by women.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

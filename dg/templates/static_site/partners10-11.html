    		<span class='subheaders'> Partnership Management </span> <br/>
			Partnership remains fundamental to Digital Green's approach which builds upon our collaborators' <br/>(1) locally relevant domain expertise,	(2) established extension operations, and (3) community-level trust networks.  
			A rigorous request for applications and due diligence processed enabled us to identify our current partners.  We continue to build on these collaborations over time.  This has included mechanisms to strengthen the operational and financial management of these partnerships as well as the sharing of learnings, challenges, and content across partners at state-, regional-, and national-levels.  
			<br/><br/>
			Many of our partners, for example, work in proximate locations to one another and these processes have proven worthwhile to clarify and resolve issues in a collaborative manner as well as to explore institutional synergies that might extend beyond the immediate project.  
			Further, we purposefully selected a variety of partners with differing expertise and scale to facilitate a richer exchange.  We are expanding the type of partners that we work with through collaborations with private agribusiness (<a class='quicklinks' href='http://www.godrejagrovet.com/' target='_blank'>Godrej Agrovet</a>), <a class='quicklinks' href='http://rural.nic.in/' target='_blank'>government</a> (Government of India's Ministry of Rural Development), and agricultural research organizations (<a class='quicklinks' href='http://irri.org/' target='_blank'>International Rice Research Institute</a>).  
			We are keen to explore opportunities to converge these partnerships in focused geographies to use our entry point of extension to link aspects across the value chain (e.g., inputs, production, aggregation, market linkages, government schemes) to improve the socioeconomic well being of farming communities in a sustainable manner.  
			To do so, we plan to partner with the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the second phase of the <a class='quicklinks' href='https://sites.google.com/site/csisaportal/' target='_blank'>Cereal System Initiative South Asia (CSISA)</a> as well as a possible project on improving rice-based rain fed agricultural systems in Bihar, India that would build upon the work of the <a class='quicklinks'  href='http://irri.org/partnerships/networks/strasa/information/about-strasa' target='_blank'>Stress-Tolerant Rice for Africa and South Asia (STRASA)</a> project with a focus on agronomy and agricultural extension.

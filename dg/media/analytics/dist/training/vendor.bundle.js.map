Each View can contain many View Containers.\n * <!-- /TODO -->\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * Given this template...\n *\n * ```\n * Count: {{items.length}}\n * <ul>\n *   <li *ngFor=\"let  item of items\">{{item}}</li>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * We have two {\\@link TemplateRef}s:\n *\n * Outer {\\@link TemplateRef}:\n * ```\n * Count: {{items.length}}\n * <ul>\n *   <ng-template ngFor let-item [ngForOf]=\"items\"></ng-template>\n * </ul>\n * ```\n *\n * Inner {\\@link TemplateRef}:\n * ```\n *   <li>{{item}}</li>\n * ```\n *\n * Notice that the original template is broken down into two separate {\\@link TemplateRef}s.\n *\n * The outer/inner {\\@link TemplateRef}s are then assembled into views like so:\n *\n * ```\n * <!-- ViewRef: outer-0 -->\n * Count: 2\n * <ul>\n *   <ng-template view-container-ref></ng-template>\n *   <!-- ViewRef: inner-1 --><li>first</li><!-- /ViewRef: inner-1 -->\n *   <!-- ViewRef: inner-2 --><li>second</li><!-- /ViewRef: inner-2 -->\n * </ul>\n * <!-- /ViewRef: outer-0 -->\n * ```\n * \\@experimental\n * @abstract\n */\nvar EmbeddedViewRef = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(EmbeddedViewRef, _super);\n    function EmbeddedViewRef() {\n        return _super !== null && _super.apply(this, arguments) || this;\n    }\n    /**\n     * @abstract\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    EmbeddedViewRef.prototype.context = function () { };\n    /**\n     * @abstract\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    EmbeddedViewRef.prototype.rootNodes = function () { };\n    return EmbeddedViewRef;\n}(ViewRef));\n/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.

To register states to an animation trigger please have a look at the {\\@link trigger\n * trigger} function.\n *\n * #### The `void` state\n *\n * The `void` state value is a reserved word that angular uses to determine when the element is not\n * apart of the application anymore (e.g. when an `ngIf` evaluates to false then the state of the\n * associated element is void).\n *\n * #### The `*` (default) state\n *\n * The `*` state (when styled) is a fallback state that will be used if the state that is being\n * animated is not declared within the trigger.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * `state` will declare an animation state with its associated styles\n * within the given trigger.\n *\n * - `stateNameExpr` can be one or more state names separated by commas.\n * - `styles` refers to the {\\@link style styling data} that will be persisted on the element once\n * the state has been reached.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // \"void\" is a reserved name for a state and is used to represent\n * // the state in which an element is detached from from the application.\n * state(\"void\", style({ height: 0 }))\n *\n * // user-defined states\n * state(\"closed\", style({ height: 0 }))\n * state(\"open, visible\", style({ height: \"*\" }))\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} name\n * @param {?} styles\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction state$1(name, styles) {\n    return { type: 0 /* State */, name: name, styles: styles };\n}\n/**\n * `keyframes` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\\@link\n * Component#animations-anchor component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of\n * how animations in Angular are used.\n *\n * `keyframes` specifies a collection of {\\@link style style} entries each optionally characterized\n * by an `offset` value.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * The `keyframes` animation function is designed to be used alongside the {\\@link animate animate}\n * animation function. Instead of applying animations from where they are currently to their\n * destination, keyframes can describe how each style entry is applied and at what point within the\n * animation arc (much like CSS Keyframe Animations do).\n *\n * For each `style()` entry an `offset` value can be set. Doing so allows to specifiy at what\n * percentage of the animate time the styles will be applied.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // the provided offset values describe when each backgroundColor value is applied.\n * animate(\"5s\", keyframes([\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"red\", offset: 0 }),\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"blue\", offset: 0.2 }),\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"orange\", offset: 0.3 }),\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"black\", offset: 1 })\n * ]))\n * ```\n *\n * Alternatively, if there are no `offset` values used within the style entries then the offsets\n * will be calculated automatically.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * animate(\"5s\", keyframes([\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"red\" }) // offset = 0\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"blue\" }) // offset = 0.33\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"orange\" }) // offset = 0.66\n *   style({ backgroundColor: \"black\" }) // offset = 1\n * ]))\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} steps\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction keyframes$1(steps) {\n    return { type: 5 /* KeyframeSequence */, steps: steps };\n}\n/**\n * `transition` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\\@link\n * Component#animations-anchor component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of\n * how animations in Angular are used.\n *\n * `transition` declares the {\\@link sequence sequence of animation steps} that will be run when the\n * provided `stateChangeExpr` value is satisfied. The `stateChangeExpr` consists of a `state1 =>\n * state2` which consists of two known states (use an asterix (`*`) to refer to a dynamic starting\n * and/or ending state).\n *\n * A function can also be provided as the `stateChangeExpr` argument for a transition and this\n * function will be executed each time a state change occurs. If the value returned within the\n * function is true then the associated animation will be run.\n *\n * Animation transitions are placed within an {\\@link trigger animation trigger}. For an transition\n * to animate to a state value and persist its styles then one or more {\\@link state animation\n * states} is expected to be defined.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * An animation transition is kicked off the `stateChangeExpr` predicate evaluates to true based on\n * what the previous state is and what the current state has become. In other words, if a transition\n * is defined that matches the old/current state criteria then the associated animation will be\n * triggered.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // all transition/state changes are defined within an animation trigger\n * trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *   // if a state is defined then its styles will be persisted when the\n *   // animation has fully completed itself\n *   state(\"on\", style({ background: \"green\" })),\n *   state(\"off\", style({ background: \"grey\" })),\n *\n *   // a transition animation that will be kicked off when the state value\n *   // bound to \"myAnimationTrigger\" changes from \"on\" to \"off\"\n *   transition(\"on => off\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // it is also possible to do run the same animation for both directions\n *   transition(\"on <=> off\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // or to define multiple states pairs separated by commas\n *   transition(\"on => off, off => void\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // this is a catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into\n *   // the page and the destination state is unknown\n *   transition(\"void => *\", [\n *     style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *     animate(500)\n *   ]),\n *\n *   // this will capture a state change between any states\n *   transition(\"* => *\", animate(\"1s 0s\")),\n *\n *   // you can also go full out and include a function\n *   transition((fromState, toState) => {\n *     // when `true` then it will allow the animation below to be invoked\n *     return fromState == \"off\" && toState == \"on\";\n *   }, animate(\"1s 0s\"))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation\n * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n * <div [\\@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * #### The final `animate` call\n *\n * If the final step within the transition steps is a call to `animate()` that **only** uses a\n * timing value with **no style data** then it will be automatically used as the final animation arc\n * for the element to animate itself to the final state. This involves an automatic mix of\n * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the\n * applied state to be presented correctly.\n *\n * ```\n * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state\n * // is currently active for \"myAnimationTrigger\"\n * transition(\"void => *\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500)\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Transition Aliases (`:enter` and `:leave`)\n *\n * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common, the `transition`\n * function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which are aliases for the `void => *` and `*\n * => void` state changes.\n *\n * ```\n * transition(\":enter\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n * ])\n * transition(\":leave\", [\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} stateChangeExpr\n * @param {?} steps\n * @return {?}\n */\nfunction transition$1(stateChangeExpr, steps) {\n    return { type: 1 /* Transition */, expr: stateChangeExpr, animation: steps };\n}\n/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.

The context\n * for each instantiated template inherits from the outer context with the given loop variable\n * set to the current item from the iterable.\n *\n * ### Local Variables\n *\n * `NgForOf` provides several exported values that can be aliased to local variables:\n *\n * - `$implicit: T`: The value of the individual items in the iterable (`ngForOf`).\n * - `ngForOf: NgIterable<T>`: The value of the iterable expression. Useful when the expression is\n * more complex then a property access, for example when using the async pipe (`userStreams |\n * async`).\n * - `index: number`: The index of the current item in the iterable.\n * - `first: boolean`: True when the item is the first item in the iterable.\n * - `last: boolean`: True when the item is the last item in the iterable.\n * - `even: boolean`: True when the item has an even index in the iterable.\n * - `odd: boolean`: True when the item has an odd index in the iterable.\n *\n * ```\n * <li *ngFor=\"let user of userObservable | async as users; index as i; first as isFirst\">\n *    {{i}}/{{users.length}}. {{user}} <span *ngIf=\"isFirst\">default</span>\n * </li>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Change Propagation\n *\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgForOf` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n * * Otherwise, the DOM element for that item will remain the same.\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls (such as `<input>` elements which accept user input) that are present. Inserted rows can\n * be animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state\n * such as user input.\n *\n * It is possible for the identities of elements in the iterator to change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response will produce objects with\n * different identities, and Angular will tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted).

Typically the:\n *  - `then` template is the inline template of `ngIf` unless bound to a different value.\n *  - `else` template is blank unless it is bound.\n *\n * # Most common usage\n *\n * The most common usage of the `ngIf` directive is to conditionally show the inline template as\n * seen in this example:\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfSimple'}\n *\n * # Showing an alternative template using `else`\n *\n * If it is necessary to display a template when the `expression` is falsy use the `else` template\n * binding as shown. Note that the `else` binding points to a `<ng-template>` labeled `#elseBlock`.\n * The template can be defined anywhere in the component view but is typically placed right after\n * `ngIf` for readability.\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfElse'}\n *\n * # Using non-inlined `then` template\n *\n * Usually the `then` template is the inlined template of the `ngIf`, but it can be changed using\n * a binding (just like `else`). Because `then` and `else` are bindings, the template references can\n * change at runtime as shown in this example.\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfThenElse'}\n *\n * # Storing conditional result in a variable\n *\n * A common pattern is that we need to show a set of properties from the same object. If the\n * object is undefined, then we have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to guard against\n * dereferencing a `null` value. This is especially the case when waiting on async data such as\n * when using the `async` pipe as shown in folowing example:\n *\n * ```\n * Hello {{ (userStream|async)?.last }}, {{ (userStream|async)?.first }}!\n * ```\n *\n * There are several inefficiencies in the above example:\n *  - We create multiple subscriptions on `userStream`. One for each `async` pipe, or two in the\n *    example above.\n *  - We cannot display an alternative screen while waiting for the data to arrive asynchronously.\n *  - We have to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties, which is cumbersome.\n *  - We have to place the `async` pipe in parenthesis.\n *\n * A better way to do this is to use `ngIf` and store the result of the condition in a local\n * variable as shown in the the example below:\n *\n * {\\@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfAs'}\n *\n * Notice that:\n *  - We use only one `async` pipe and hence only one subscription gets created.\n *  - `ngIf` stores the result of the `userStream|async` in the local variable `user`.\n *  - The local `user` can then be bound repeatedly in a more efficient way.\n *  - No need to use the safe-traversal-operator `?.` to access properties as `ngIf` will only\n *    display the data if `userStream` returns a value.\n *  - We can display an alternative template while waiting for the data.\n *\n * ### Syntax\n *\n * Simple form:\n * - `<div *ngIf=\"condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<div template=\"ngIf condition\">...</div>`\n * - `<ng-template [ngIf]=\"condition\"><div>...</div></ng-template>`\n *\n * Form with an else block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; else elseBlock\">...</div>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * Form with a `then` and `else` block:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition; then thenBlock else elseBlock\"></div>\n * <ng-template #thenBlock>...</ng-template>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * Form with storing the value locally:\n * ```\n * <div *ngIf=\"condition as value; else elseBlock\">{{value}}</div>\n * <ng-template #elseBlock>...</ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar NgIf = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _viewContainer\n     * @param {?} templateRef\n     */\n    function NgIf(_viewContainer, templateRef) {\n        this._viewContainer = _viewContainer;\n        this._context = new NgIfContext();\n        this._thenTemplateRef = null;\n        this._elseTemplateRef = null;\n        this._thenViewRef = null;\n        this._elseViewRef = null;\n        this._thenTemplateRef = templateRef;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(NgIf.prototype, \"ngIf\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} condition\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (condition) {\n            this._context.$implicit = this._context.ngIf = condition;\n            this._updateView();\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgIf.prototype, \"ngIfThen\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} templateRef\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (templateRef) {\n            this._thenTemplateRef = templateRef;\n            this._thenViewRef = null; // clear previous view if any.\n            this._updateView();\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgIf.prototype, \"ngIfElse\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} templateRef\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (templateRef) {\n            this._elseTemplateRef = templateRef;\n            this._elseViewRef = null; // clear previous view if any.\n            this._updateView();\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgIf.prototype._updateView = function () {\n        if (this._context.$implicit) {\n            if (!this._thenViewRef) {\n                this._viewContainer.clear();\n                this._elseViewRef = null;\n                if (this._thenTemplateRef) {\n                    this._thenViewRef =\n                        this._viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(this._thenTemplateRef, this._context);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        else {\n            if (!this._elseViewRef) {\n                this._viewContainer.clear();\n                this._thenViewRef = null;\n                if (this._elseTemplateRef) {\n                    this._elseViewRef =\n                        this._viewContainer.createEmbeddedView(this._elseTemplateRef, this._context);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    };\n    return NgIf;\n}());\nNgIf.decorators = [\n    { type: Directive, args: [{ selector: '[ngIf]' },] },\n];\n/**\n * @nocollapse\n */\nNgIf.ctorParameters = function () { return [\n    { type: ViewContainerRef, },\n    { type: TemplateRef, },\n]; };\nNgIf.propDecorators = {\n    'ngIf': [{ type: Input },],\n    'ngIfThen': [{ type: Input },],\n    'ngIfElse': [{ type: Input },],\n};\n/**\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar NgIfContext = (function () {\n    function NgIfContext() {\n        this.$implicit = null;\n        this.ngIf = null;\n    }\n    return NgIfContext;\n}());\n/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.

If your option values happen to be objects (and you'd like to save the\n * selection in your form as an object), use `ngValue` instead:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/selectControl/select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * In reactive forms, you'll also want to add your form directive (`formControlName` or\n * `formControl`) on the main `<select>` tag. Like in the former example, you have the\n * choice of binding to the  `value` or `ngValue` property on the select's options.\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/reactiveSelectControl/reactive_select_control_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * ### Caveat: Option selection\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to select option. It's possible for the identities of items\n * to change while the data does not. This can happen, for example, if the items are produced\n * from an RPC to the server, and that RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the\n * second response will produce objects with different identities.\n *\n * To customize the default option comparison algorithm, `<select>` supports `compareWith` input.\n * `compareWith` takes a **function** which has two arguments: `option1` and `option2`.\n * If `compareWith` is given, Angular selects option by the return value of the function.\n *\n * #### Syntax\n *\n * ```\n * <select [compareWith]=\"compareFn\"  [(ngModel)]=\"selectedCountries\">\n *     <option *ngFor=\"let country of countries\" [ngValue]=\"country\">\n *         {{country.name}}\n *     </option>\n * </select>\n *\n * compareFn(c1: Country, c2: Country): boolean {\n *     return c1 && c2 ? c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Note: We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired\n * for selects in Firefox and IE:\n * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350\n * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/\n *\n * * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar SelectControlValueAccessor = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _renderer\n     * @param {?} _elementRef\n     */\n    function SelectControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        this._optionMap = new Map();\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        this._idCounter = 0;\n        this.onChange = function (_) { };\n        this.onTouched = function () { };\n        this._compareWith = ɵlooseIdentical;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype, \"compareWith\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (fn) {\n            if (typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                throw new Error(\"compareWith must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn));\n            }\n            this._compareWith = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = function (value) {\n        this.value = value;\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = this._getOptionId(value);\n        if (id == null) {\n            this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'selectedIndex', -1);\n        }\n        var /** @type {?} */ valueString = _buildValueString(id, value);\n        this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'value', valueString);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnChange = function (fn) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.onChange = function (valueString) {\n            _this.value = valueString;\n            fn(_this._getOptionValue(valueString));\n        };\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnTouched = function (fn) { this.onTouched = fn; };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} isDisabled\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype.setDisabledState = function (isDisabled) {\n        this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'disabled', isDisabled);\n    };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._registerOption = function () { return (this._idCounter++).toString(); };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionId = function (value) {\n        for (var _i = 0, _a = Array.from(this._optionMap.keys()); _i < _a.length; _i++) {\n            var id = _a[_i];\n            if (this._compareWith(this._optionMap.get(id), value))\n                return id;\n        }\n        return null;\n    };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} valueString\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionValue = function (valueString) {\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = _extractId(valueString);\n        return this._optionMap.has(id) ?

c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * \\@stable\n */\nvar SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor = (function () {\n    /**\n     * @param {?} _renderer\n     * @param {?} _elementRef\n     */\n    function SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor(_renderer, _elementRef) {\n        this._renderer = _renderer;\n        this._elementRef = _elementRef;\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        this._optionMap = new Map();\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        this._idCounter = 0;\n        this.onChange = function (_) { };\n        this.onTouched = function () { };\n        this._compareWith = ɵlooseIdentical;\n    }\n    Object.defineProperty(SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype, \"compareWith\", {\n        /**\n         * @param {?} fn\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        set: function (fn) {\n            if (typeof fn !== 'function') {\n                throw new Error(\"compareWith must be a function, but received \" + JSON.stringify(fn));\n            }\n            this._compareWith = fn;\n        },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    /**\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype.writeValue = function (value) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.value = value;\n        var /** @type {?} */ optionSelectedStateSetter;\n        if (Array.isArray(value)) {\n            // convert values to ids\n            var /** @type {?} */ ids_1 = value.map(function (v) { return _this._getOptionId(v); });\n            optionSelectedStateSetter = function (opt, o) { opt._setSelected(ids_1.indexOf(o.toString()) > -1); };\n        }\n        else {\n            optionSelectedStateSetter = function (opt, o) { opt._setSelected(false); };\n        }\n        this._optionMap.forEach(optionSelectedStateSetter);\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnChange = function (fn) {\n        var _this = this;\n        this.onChange = function (_) {\n            var /** @type {?} */ selected = [];\n            if (_.hasOwnProperty('selectedOptions')) {\n                var /** @type {?} */ options = _.selectedOptions;\n                for (var /** @type {?} */ i = 0; i < options.length; i++) {\n                    var /** @type {?} */ opt = options.item(i);\n                    var /** @type {?} */ val = _this._getOptionValue(opt.value);\n                    selected.push(val);\n                }\n            }\n            else {\n                var /** @type {?} */ options = (_.options);\n                for (var /** @type {?} */ i = 0; i < options.length; i++) {\n                    var /** @type {?} */ opt = options.item(i);\n                    if (opt.selected) {\n                        var /** @type {?} */ val = _this._getOptionValue(opt.value);\n                        selected.push(val);\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            _this.value = selected;\n            fn(selected);\n        };\n    };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} fn\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype.registerOnTouched = function (fn) { this.onTouched = fn; };\n    /**\n     * @param {?} isDisabled\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype.setDisabledState = function (isDisabled) {\n        this._renderer.setElementProperty(this._elementRef.nativeElement, 'disabled', isDisabled);\n    };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype._registerOption = function (value) {\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = (this._idCounter++).toString();\n        this._optionMap.set(id, value);\n        return id;\n    };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} value\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionId = function (value) {\n        for (var _i = 0, _a = Array.from(this._optionMap.keys()); _i < _a.length; _i++) {\n            var id = _a[_i];\n            if (this._compareWith(/** @type {?} */ ((this._optionMap.get(id)))._value, value))\n                return id;\n        }\n        return null;\n    };\n    /**\n     * \\@internal\n     * @param {?} valueString\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    SelectMultipleControlValueAccessor.prototype._getOptionValue = function (valueString) {\n        var /** @type {?} */ id = _extractId$1(valueString);\n        return this._optionMap.has(id) ?

For example, if one of\n * the controls in a `FormArray` is invalid, the entire array becomes invalid.\n *\n * `FormArray` is one of the three fundamental building blocks used to define forms in Angular,\n * along with {\\@link FormControl} and {\\@link FormGroup}.\n *\n * \\@howToUse\n *\n * When instantiating a {\\@link FormArray}, pass in an array of child controls as the first\n * argument.\n *\n * ### Example\n *\n * ```\n * const arr = new FormArray([\n *   new FormControl('Nancy', Validators.minLength(2)),\n *   new FormControl('Drew'),\n * ]);\n *\n * console.log(arr.value);   // ['Nancy', 'Drew']\n * console.log(arr.status);  // 'VALID'\n * ```\n *\n * You can also include array-level validators as the second arg, or array-level async\n * validators as the third arg.

All you need is the\n * `ngModel` selector to activate it.\n *\n * It accepts a domain model as an optional {\\@link Input}. If you have a one-way binding\n * to `ngModel` with `[]` syntax, changing the value of the domain model in the component\n * class will set the value in the view. If you have a two-way binding with `[()]` syntax\n * (also known as 'banana-box syntax'), the value in the UI will always be synced back to\n * the domain model in your class as well.\n *\n * If you wish to inspect the properties of the associated {\\@link FormControl} (like\n * validity state), you can also export the directive into a local template variable using\n * `ngModel` as the key (ex: `#myVar=\"ngModel\"`). You can then access the control using the\n * directive's `control` property, but most properties you'll need (like `valid` and `dirty`)\n * will fall through to the control anyway, so you can access them directly. You can see a\n * full list of properties directly available in {\\@link AbstractControlDirective}.\n *\n * The following is an example of a simple standalone control using `ngModel`:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleNgModel/simple_ng_model_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * When using the `ngModel` within `<form>` tags, you'll also need to supply a `name` attribute\n * so that the control can be registered with the parent form under that name.\n *\n * It's worth noting that in the context of a parent form, you often can skip one-way or\n * two-way binding because the parent form will sync the value for you. You can access\n * its properties by exporting it into a local template variable using `ngForm` (ex:\n * `#f=\"ngForm\"`). Then you can pass it where it needs to go on submit.\n *\n * If you do need to populate initial values into your form, using a one-way binding for\n * `ngModel` tends to be sufficient as long as you use the exported form's value rather\n * than the domain model's value on submit.\n *\n * Take a look at an example of using `ngModel` within a form:\n *\n * {\\@example forms/ts/simpleForm/simple_form_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * To see `ngModel` examples with different form control types, see:\n *\n * * Radio buttons: {\\@link RadioControlValueAccessor}\n * * Selects: {\\@link SelectControlValueAccessor}\n *\n * **npm package**: `\\@angular/forms`\n *\n * **NgModule**: `FormsModule`\n *\n *  \\@stable\n */\nvar NgModel = (function (_super) {\n    __extends(NgModel, _super);\n    /**\n     * @param {?} parent\n     * @param {?} validators\n     * @param {?} asyncValidators\n     * @param {?} valueAccessors\n     */\n    function NgModel(parent, validators, asyncValidators, valueAccessors) {\n        var _this = _super.call(this) || this;\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        _this._control = new FormControl();\n        /**\n         * \\@internal\n         */\n        _this._registered = false;\n        _this.update = new EventEmitter();\n        _this._parent = parent;\n        _this._rawValidators = validators || [];\n        _this._rawAsyncValidators = asyncValidators || [];\n        _this.valueAccessor = selectValueAccessor(_this, valueAccessors);\n        return _this;\n    }\n    /**\n     * @param {?} changes\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnChanges = function (changes) {\n        this._checkForErrors();\n        if (!this._registered)\n            this._setUpControl();\n        if ('isDisabled' in changes) {\n            this._updateDisabled(changes);\n        }\n        if (isPropertyUpdated(changes, this.viewModel)) {\n            this._updateValue(this.model);\n            this.viewModel = this.model;\n        }\n    };\n    /**\n     * @return {?}\n     */\n    NgModel.prototype.ngOnDestroy = function () { this.formDirective && this.formDirective.removeControl(this); };\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"control\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () { return this._control; },\n        enumerable: true,\n        configurable: true\n    });\n    Object.defineProperty(NgModel.prototype, \"path\", {\n        /**\n         * @return {?}\n         */\n        get: function () {\n            return this._parent ?

This means if `func` makes AJAX request, that request\n     * will be made every time someone subscribes to resulting Observable, but not before.\n     *\n     * Optionally, selector function can be passed to `bindObservable`. That function\n     * takes the same arguments as callback, and returns value\n     * that will be emitted by Observable instead of callback parameters themselves.\n     * Even though by default multiple arguments passed to callback appear in the stream as array,\n     * selector function will be called with arguments directly, just as callback would.\n     * This means you can imagine default selector (when one is not provided explicitly)\n     * as function that aggregates all its arguments into array, or simply returns first argument,\n     * if there is only one.\n     *\n     * Last optional parameter - {@link Scheduler} - can be used to control when call\n     * to `func` happens after someone subscribes to Observable, as well as when results\n     * passed to callback will be emitted. By default subscription to Observable calls `func`\n     * synchronously, but using `Scheduler.async` as last parameter will defer call to input function,\n     * just like wrapping that call in `setTimeout` with time `0` would. So if you use async Scheduler\n     * and call `subscribe` on output Observable, all function calls that are currently executing,\n     * will end before `func` is invoked.\n     *\n     * When it comes to emitting results passed to callback, by default they are emitted\n     * immediately after `func` invokes callback. In particular, if callback is called synchronously,\n     * then subscription to resulting Observable will call `next` function synchronously as well.\n     * If you want to defer that call, using `Scheduler.async` will, again, do the job.\n     * This means that by using `Scheduler.async` you can, in a sense, ensure that `func`\n     * always calls its callback asynchronously, thus avoiding terrifying Zalgo.\n     *\n     * Note that Observable created by output function will always emit only one value\n     * and then complete right after. Even if `func` calls callback multiple times, values from\n     * second and following calls will never appear in the stream. If you need to\n     * listen for multiple calls, you probably want to use {@link fromEvent} or\n     * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n     *\n     * If `func` depends on some context (`this` property), that context will be set\n     * to the same context that output function has at call time. In particular, if `func`\n     * is called as method of some object, in order to preserve proper behaviour,\n     * it is recommended to set context of output function to that object as well,\n     * provided `func` is not already bound.\n     *\n     * If input function calls its callback in \"node style\" (i.e. first argument to callback is\n     * optional error parameter signaling whether call failed or not), {@link bindNodeCallback}\n     * provides convenient error handling and probably is a better choice.\n     * `bindCallback` will treat such functions without any difference and error parameter\n     * (whether passed or not) will always be interpreted as regular callback argument.\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Convert jQuery's getJSON to an Observable API</caption>\n     * // Suppose we have jQuery.getJSON('/my/url', callback)\n     * var getJSONAsObservable = Rx.Observable.bindCallback(jQuery.getJSON);\n     * var result = getJSONAsObservable('/my/url');\n     * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));\n     *\n     *\n     * @example <caption>Receive array of arguments passed to callback</caption>\n     * someFunction((a, b, c) => {\n     *   console.log(a);

This means if some Observable emits\n * values before other Observables started emitting, all that values but last\n * will be lost. On the other hand, is some Observable does not emit value but\n * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without\n * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from\n * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does\n * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit\n * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some\n * value.\n *\n * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables\n * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined\n * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of\n * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case\n * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last\n * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`\n * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.\n *\n * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes\n * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.\n * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable\n * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array\n * of values, but values themselves. That means default `project` can be imagined\n * as function that takes all its arguments and puts them into an array.\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Combine two timer Observables</caption>\n * const firstTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(0, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting from now\n * const secondTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(500, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting 0,5s from now\n * const combinedTimers = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(firstTimer, secondTimer);\n * combinedTimers.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0] after 0.5s\n * // [1, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 1] after 1.5s\n * // [2, 1] after 2s\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Combine an array of Observables</caption>\n * const observables = [1, 5, 10].map(\n *   n => Rx.Observable.of(n).delay(n * 1000).startWith(0) // emit 0 and then emit n after n seconds\n * );\n * const combined = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(observables);\n * combined.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0, 0] immediately\n * // [1, 0, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 5, 0] after 5s\n * // [1, 5, 10] after 10s\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Use project function to dynamically calculate the Body-Mass Index</caption>\n * var weight = Rx.Observable.of(70, 72, 76, 79, 75);\n * var height = Rx.Observable.of(1.76, 1.77, 1.78);\n * var bmi = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(weight, height, (w, h) => w / (h * h));\n * bmi.subscribe(x => console.log('BMI is ' + x));\n *\n * // With output to console:\n * // BMI is 24.212293388429753\n * // BMI is 23.93948099205209\n * // BMI is 23.671253629592222\n *\n *\n * @see {@link combineAll}\n * @see {@link merge}\n * @see {@link withLatestFrom}\n *\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable1 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable2 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n * More than one input Observables may be given as arguments\n * or an array of Observables may be given as the first argument.\n * @param {function} [project] An optional function to project the values from\n * the combined latest values into a new value on the output Observable.\n * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler=null] The IScheduler to use for subscribing to\n * each input Observable.\n * @return {Observable} An Observable of projected values from the most recent\n * values from each input Observable, or an array of the most recent values from\n * each input Observable.\n * @static true\n * @name combineLatest\n * @owner Observable\n */\nfunction combineLatest() {\n    var observables = [];\n    for (var _i = 0; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {\n        observables[_i - 0] = arguments[_i];\n    }\n    var project = null;\n    var scheduler = null;\n    if (isScheduler_1.isScheduler(observables[observables.length - 1])) {\n        scheduler = observables.pop();\n    }\n    if (typeof observables[observables.length - 1] === 'function') {\n        project = observables.pop();\n    }\n    // if the first and only other argument besides the resultSelector is an array\n    // assume it's been called with `combineLatest([obs1, obs2, obs3], project)`\n    if (observables.length === 1 && isArray_1.isArray(observables[0])) {\n        observables = observables[0];\n    }\n    return new ArrayObservable_1.ArrayObservable(observables, scheduler).lift(new combineLatest_1.CombineLatestOperator(project));\n}\nexports.combineLatest = combineLatest;\n//# sourceMappingURL=combineLatest.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/rxjs/observable/combineLatest.js\n// module id = 430\n// module chunks = 3","\"use strict\";\nvar concat_1 = require('../operator/concat');\nexports.concat = concat_1.concatStatic;\n//# sourceMappingURL=concat.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/rxjs/observable/concat.js\n// module id = 431\n// module chunks = 3","\"use strict\";\nvar DeferObservable_1 = require('./DeferObservable');\nexports.defer = DeferObservable_1.DeferObservable.create;\n//# sourceMappingURL=defer.js.map\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/rxjs/observable/defer.js\n// module id = 432\n// module chunks = 3","\"use strict\";\nvar __extends = (this && this.__extends) || function (d, b) {\n    for (var p in b) if (b.hasOwnProperty(p)) d[p] = b[p];\n    function __() { this.constructor = d; }\n    d.prototype = b === null ?

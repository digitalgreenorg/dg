		<PLACE>Marigold Farmer Experience</PLACE>
		<DESC>"The video based approach has several important advantages to traditional forms of agricultural content, which is typically not in the local language, intended for a literate audience, uses expert terminology, lacks grassroots level practicalities, and remains inaccessible in a sea of scattered media. Farmers, by the nature of their occupation, rely on their auditory and visual senses and video, though not perfect, comes closest to capturing the scene in detail. Video creation tends to be faster and less expensive than other types of media, as advanced preparation in "lesson"-planning can minimize post-production editing. Video can compress the time needed to reveal the change. Video provides a means of bringing relevant demonstrations into the homes of farmers. Video also reduces the human resources required to follow-up with individual farmers and demonstrate time-consuming methods in the field."</DESC>

		<DESC>"Sometimes the solutions aren't cool because of the technology. They're really cool because of the impact. One that I'll cite, we call Digital Green, which was done by our Indian research lab which has a particular focus on the needs of the 2 billion people at the bottom of the pyramid. They went out to the farmers and saw that a direct use of computing wouldn't be possible: no cell phone network and no electricity. The real problem is farming productivity. If you have a drought and didn't grow enough during the season before, you literally suffer malnutrition."</DESC>

                            <p class="copy copy-margin">Digital Green is evolving: It started as an idea that became a research project that was evaluated and then extended and now is scaling up. In some ways, we have crossed from one stepping-stone to the next in sequence. In other ways, the journey has been more iterative and cyclical. 
                            </p>
                            
                            <p class="copy copy-margin">
                            	I recently visited Mahabubnagar, Andhra Pradesh to meet a group of eleven women from the nearby area who were getting introduced to filmmaking for the very first time.  They had never held a camera nor been on camera before and, though I couldn't understand a word of the Telugu that they spoke, they were clearly engrossed in learning how to do so. In less than two and a half days, these women were developing storyboards, shooting videos in the field, editing them on a computer, and sharing tips with one another on how they could make them better. Check out a 3-minute highlight reel of the women in action <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zk9VRn6bT6U' target='_blank'>here</a>
                            </p>
                            
                            <p class="copy copy-margin">
                            	Of course, this was just a beginning for the women - and for us.  That training program marked the beginning of our partnership with the Government of India's National Rural Livelihoods Mission, <a href='http://go.worldbank.org/BSS10ZFQG0'>one of the world's largest poverty reduction initiatives</a>, in which we will be looking to connect with over 1 million farmers across 10,000 villages over the next three years.  It' an exciting opportunity for scale and sustainability, but the magnitude of such numbers is difficult to fathom.  Just as we <a href='/update' target='_blank'>started</a> in 2006 and the <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HTsrigrUQY' target='_blank'> boot camp</a> that launched the Digital Green team in 2009, it's a process that involves one farmer, one village at a time. 
    						</p>
    						
    						<p class="copy copy-margin">
    							Together with our <a href='/partnerexecutive' target='_blank'>partners</a>, we're working to help build and support the aspirations that individuals seek to achieve.  Our network of <a href='/teammember' target='_blank'>team members</a> and <a href='/partnerexecutive' target='_blank'>partners</a> has <a href='/projectprogress10' target='_blank'>developed our capabilities considerably</a> over the last five years. Seven NGO partners now work with us in over 900 villages across 6 states in India and have produced over 1,800 videos that have been screened more than 45,000 times to over 60,000 farmers. In a rough assessment in Orissa, we found that the cost-effectiveness of two of our partners' existing interventions increased by a factor of 4-5x and had resulted in gains of around US$ 242 per farmer in the first year of our work together.

                            	We're humbled to see that sort of impact and plan to work with <a href='http://www.poverty-action.org' target='_blank'>Innovations for Poverty Action</a> for a more rigorous assessment.  We also continue to capture, analyze, and share data on the progress we're making in near real-time on our <a href='http://analytics.digitalgreen.org' target='_blank'>analytics dashboards</a>.

                            	We have much farther to go and we've been reflecting on <a href='/challenge10' target='_blank'>how we can do things better</a>.  Most especially, nurturing our partnerships with organizations and communities: listening to what's going well, what's not, and how we can improve our work together.   We're iterating our <a href='/sop' target='_blank'>standard operating procedures</a> based on the learnings and challenges that we're encountering in the field and have drafted a broader <a href='/qualityassurance' target='_blank'>framework for ensuring quality</a> as we go to scale.

                            	Though our work has focused on agricultural development, the videos feature a diverse range of issues: from accessing inputs to organizing self-help groups to facilitating microcredit and savings to improving production techniques to linking with markets and government programs. As we work with the Government of India's Ministry of Rural Development and others, we'll be leveraging the platform to integrate initiatives in public health and nutrition and primary school education.

                            	Digital Green has primarily scaled by building on its partnerships with seven non-governmental organizations- namely, <a href='http://www.pradan.net' target='_blank'>PRADAN</a>, <a href='http://www.baif.org.in/aspx_pages/index.asp' target='_blank'>BAIF</a>, <a href='http://www.samprag.org/' target='_blank'>Samaj Pragati Sahayog</a>, <a href='http://www.accessdev.org/' target='_blank'>ACCESS</a>, <a href='http://www.asaindia.org/' target='_blank'>Action for Social Advancement</a>, <a href='http://www.pragatikoraput.org' target='_blank'>PRAGATI</a>,  and <a href='http://www.ngogateway.org/user_homepage/index.php?id=239' target='_blank'>VARRAT</a> - 
    							and recently began a partnership with the Government of India's National Rural Livelihoods Mission.  
    							As described in our 2009-10 annual report, these partnerships were established after a competitive review and due diligence process that evaluated the domain expertise, 
    							operational strength, and community-level rapport of each organization.  Sub agreements then were finalized in which mechanisms for cost effectiveness, quality assurance, and sustainability were emphasized. 
    		
    		 
    							Digital Green's team bootstrapped the technology and social organizational elements of the model with each partner and progressively transitioned to regional offices in Bangalore, Bhopal, Bhubaneswar, and New Delhi to provide the necessary technology development 
    							and resource agency support to each partner.  The Digital Green system now involves 58,902 farmers across six states in India: Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Orissa.  Supporting these activities, the Digital Green team includes 
    							22 core team members, 102 partner staff, and 524 community intermediaries. On average, it took 1.3 days to operationalize each additional village in the first year and 0.6 days in the second year, a 2-fold gain in the efficiency of our own work. 
                        	</p>
                        	
                        	<p class="copy">
                            	As Digital Green system has scaled, we have focused on enhancing the system to support the scope and diversity of stakeholders at the institutional-level partners as well as grassrootslevel communities that we work with.  
    							An internal team has been established to refine our training programs to advance the capabilities of the community intermediaries involved in producing videos, mediating video screenings, and capturing farmerlevel feedback to 
					    		sustain participation and adoption levels over time. We also initiated an effort to improve upon our <a href='/qualityassurance' target='_blank'>quality assurance framework</a> by building on our primary objective of improving the efficiency of our partners' existing extension 
					    		operations using our technology and social organization based model to now evaluate the ultimate productivity and income improvement that the content and our approach provide to the farmers that we work with.  
					    		In a preliminary assessment with two partners, <a href='http://www.pradan.net' target='_blank'>PRADAN</a> and <a href='http://www.ngogateway.org/user_homepage/index.php?id=239' target='_blank'>VARRAT</a>, in Orissa, we found that the classical extension systems that these NGOs operated had a cost per adoption of US$ 10-18 whereas the 
					    		Digital Green model integrated with their existing extension operations had a cost per adoption US$ 3-4- an improvement of 45 times, per dollar spent.  Additionally, a very prelimianry, limited sample analysis found that in the 
					    		first 8 months in which the Digital Green system had been deployed resulted in an average cumulative increase in incomes of US$ 242 per farmer in one cluster of villages in Orissa.  We have planned a more rigorous evaluation of the 
					    		efficiency and efficacy of the Digital Green both internally as well as in collaboration with researchers from <a href='http://www.poverty-action.org' target='_blank'>Innovations for Poverty Action</a>, Yale University, and University of California, Berkeley using 
					    		multiintervention, randomized controlled trial methods for the next phase of our work.

						    	We have also refined our backend technology stack to better capture and analyze progress data and farmer feedback from areas that have limited to no electricity and Internet connectivity through a combination of paper-, phone-, and web-based channels.  
						    	We have identified four areas in our work that require particular focus: partnership management, impact assessment, quality assurance, and sustainability.  Internal teams have been constituted to investigate each of these areas by surveying our existing work 
						    	across partners and geographies and capturing the challenges and learnings that we have had till date. A combination of small-scale pilots and reflection exercises are then used to develop our capabilities in each area.  We have also strengthened our organizational

    							We are working with a manufacturer in India to develop and employ a mobile device that combines the functionality of a cell phone, camera, and pico projector that is currently priced at US$ 135.  We envision that such a device could replace the standalone pico projectors that we currently use within the next 5 years and 
    							that the price point could reduce to a level that would be affordable to a larger fraction of rural consumers.

								(1) locally relevant domain expertise,	(2) established extension operations, and (3) community-level trust networks. A rigorous request for applications and due diligence processed enabled us to identify our current partners. We continue to build on these collaborations over time. This has included mechanisms to strengthen the operational and financial management of these partnerships as well as the sharing of learnings, challenges, and content across partners at state-, regional-, and national-levels.

                            	Many of our partners, for example, work in proximate locations to one another and these processes have proven worthwhile to clarify and resolve issues in a collaborative manner as well as to explore institutional synergies that might extend beyond the immediate project.  
								Further, we purposefully selected a variety of partners with differing expertise and scale to facilitate a richer exchange.  We are expanding the type of partners that we work with through collaborations with private agribusiness (<a href='http://www.godrejagrovet.com/' target='_blank'>Godrej Agrovet</a>), <a href='http://rural.nic.in/' target='_blank'>government</a> (Government of India's Ministry of Rural Development), and agricultural research organizations (<a class='quicklinks' href='http://irri.org/' target='_blank'>International Rice Research Institute</a>).  
								We are keen to explore opportunities to converge these partnerships in focused geographies to use our entry point of extension to link aspects across the value chain (e.g., inputs, production, aggregation, market linkages, government schemes) to improve the socioeconomic well being of farming communities in a sustainable manner.  
								To do so, we plan to partner with the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the second phase of the <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/csisaportal/' target='_blank'>Cereal System Initiative South Asia (CSISA)</a> as well as a possible project on improving rice-based rain fed agricultural systems in Bihar, India that would build upon the work of the <a class='quicklinks'  href='http://irri.org/partnerships/networks/strasa/information/about-strasa' target='_blank'>Stress-Tolerant Rice for Africa and South Asia (STRASA)</a> project with a focus on agronomy and agricultural extension.

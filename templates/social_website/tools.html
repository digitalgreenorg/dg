                            <p class="copy copy-margin">COCO is a highly sophisticated data input system that forms the base of Digital Green's software stack. The creation of this system was inspired by persistent and at times debilitating issues at the field level, specifically technical issues in gathering and storing information. To alleviate these problems, Digital Green's software team conceived of a highly flexible and robust alternative that sought to make information gathering and input at Digital Green less error prone, fast, and resilient to persistent data connectivity issues in remote locations.</p>
                            
                            <p class="copy copy-margin">Most applicable to NGOs with a sizeable field operation, COCO's singular unique selling proposition is the ability to take the application offline in low and limited bandwidth locations, with uninterrupted usage in the browser. COCO is designed to support up to 100,000 users located anywhere in the world and only requires internet connectivity whenever a user is ready to synchronize their data with our global repository. Built as a robust standalone application in the Internet browser, COCO requires no additional software installation or maintenance. The system is designed in an open-source, customizable framework that can be deployed without the need of IT/engineering staff.

                            <p class="copy copy-margin">COCO is architected as a Java web-framework, similar to and in proximate feature parity with popular frameworks such as Django or Ruby on Rails. The core of COCO's framework comprises of a variety of open source technologies. In light of achieving maximum speed as a browser application, COCO is developed using the GWT 2.0 (Google Web Toolkit) Java-Javascript framework. To enable offline mode, COCO employs the use of Google Gears, a browser plug-in that provides a persistent Sqlite database to store data relationally and a local cache to access all requisite static content. For deployment in offline mode, a compiled Javascript file is generated and made available in Google Gear's local cache for access by the browser; COCO in online mode operates as any other web application. More details on our architecture will be available later.

                            <p class="copy copy-margin">Digital Green's technology stack has been primarily geared toward operationalizing our work with partners and communities in the field. At the same time, progress monitoring tools, like our analytics dashboards, are accessible via our website to the general public.</p>
                            
                            <p class="copy">
                             We have found that these systems provide transparency and even encourage healthy competition across our partners to better manage their operations. Recently, we began to see how our core work in the field might connect with other audiences who could learn and engage with the issues of agriculture and rural development. To this end, our technology team developed a social game, called Wonder Village, which was launched on Facebook. Through the game, players set up a simulated village economy and have opportunities to relate with the actual farmers that we work with in the field. Players are placed in a resource-constrained setting and pursue quests like setting up small farms of paddy and maize and supplying raw materials to farmers' markets. The game follows a so-called "freemium" model which allows users to play for free and allows users to purchase virtual currency to advance more quickly. With over 80m users playing Facebook games like Farmville and Cityville every month for an average of 15 min a day, Wonder Village could represent a novel approach to raise awareness and fundraise in the development sector.

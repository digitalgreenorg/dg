		Digital Green builds and deploys information and communication technology to amplify the effectiveness of development efforts around the world to affect sustained, social change. The Digital Green
        system combines technology and social organization to improve the cost-effectiveness and broaden the community participation of existing
        agricultural extension systems. The unique components of the Digital Green system include (1) a participatory process for local video
        production, (2) a human-mediated instruction model for video dissemination and training, (3) a hardware and software technology
        platform for exchanging data in areas with limited Internet and electrical grid connectivity, and (4) an iterative model to
        progressively better address the needs and interests of the community with analytical tools and interactive phone-based feedback channels.
		<br/> <br/>
		
		Unlike some systems that expect information or communication technology alone to deliver useful knowledge to farmers, Digital Green
        works with existing, people-based extension systems and aims to amplify their effectiveness. While video provides a point of focus, it
        is people and social dynamics that ultimately make Digital Green work. Local social networks are tapped to connect farmers with experts; the
        thrill of appearing "on TV" motivates farmers; and homophily is exploited to minimize the distance between teacher and learner.
		<br/> <br/>
		
		The Digital Green system combines technology and social organization to maximize the potential of building the capacity of farmers on
        improved, sustainable agriculture and allied livelihood interventions. The videos that are produced by farmers, of farmers, and for farmers
        across our field locations are periodically synchronized with our global library of videos on our website. Data associated with the
        videos, including their reach, the feedback of viewers, and the ultimate take up of the featured practices or techniques, is also
        aggregated and analyzed in near real-time on our analytics dashboards. These analytics dashboards are built upon an data management
        framework, called COCO, which allows even remote areas with limited Internet and electrical connectivity to exchange data with the world.

    		Digital Green works to build technologies and to serve as a resource agency to maximize the potential of the partners and the communities that we work with. The last year has been one of great learning and progress in the field and as a team.
    		<br/>
    		<br/>
    		We spun-out of <a class='quicklinks' href='http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/india/projects/digitalgreen/' target='_blank'>Microsoft Research</a> and came together as the Digital Green team for our first <a class='quicklinks' href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HTsrigrUQY'/ target='_blank'>orientation boot camp</a> in May 2009.  Our operations team <a class='quicklinks' href='http://sites.digitalgreen.org/inside-digital-green/updates/y1q0birthing'/>laid the groundwork</a> by working closely with our partners: understanding local contexts, cultivating relationships, and developing a framework for ensuring quality.
    		<br/>
    		Initially, our team members were <a class='quicklinks' href='http://sites.digitalgreen.org/inside-digital-green/updates/december242009-' target='_blank'>embedded</a> in the field offices of our partners.  This proved useful in providing on-site training for our partners as well as ourselves.  As the work gained <a class='quicklinks' href='http://sites.digitalgreen.org/inside-digital-green/updates/march312010-y1q2traction' target='_blank'>traction</a> in the field, we entered into new partnerships through a rigorous <a class='quicklinks' href='/rfa'>due diligence process</a> that emphasized our role as "trainer of trainers" and focused on improving the cost-effectiveness of our partners.  
    		Our team <a class='quicklinks' href='http://sites.digitalgreen.org/inside-digital-green/updates/june292010transition' target='_blank'>transitioned</a> to this model by relocating to <a class='quicklinks' href='/contact'>offices</a> in the state capitals of Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, and Karnataka and providing support to our partners from these hubs.      		
    		<br/>	<br/>
    		The Digital Green system now extends to over 400 villages and involves over 26,000 farmers.  During the last year, over 700 videos have been produced of farmers, by farmers, and for farmers; 8,000 mediated screenings of videos have taken place in these villages; and 6,500 better agricultural techniques have been taken up by farmers on their fields.  As the system has scaled, we have encountered challenges and gained some important <a class='quicklinks' href='/lessonslearned'>learnings</a> .  A key focus area is quality assurance.  We have developed <a class='quicklinks' href='/sop'>standard operating procedures</a> and are strengthening mechanisms for internal audits and third-party certification reviews. 
    		<br/> <br/>		
    		Our technology team has built the software platform that powers Digital Green with an open-source data management framework, called <a class='quicklinks' href='/tech'>COCO</a>, which enables rural areas that often have limited Internet connectivity to exchange data with the world and an <a class='quicklinks' href='http://analytics.digitalgreen.org' target='_blank'>Analytics</a> suite of dashboards to better coordinate our operations and to analyze our progress across the country based on time and location.  We also launched a new <a class='quicklinks' href='/' target='_blank'>website</a> and an interface to sort through the expanding <a class='quicklinks' href='/analytics/video_search'>library of videos</a> that our network of partners and communities is producing.  And in the field, we replaced bulky and expensive camcorders, TVs, and DVD players with low-cost, high definition pocket video cameras to capture videos and increasingly brighter, battery-operated pico projectors to disseminate them.
			<br/>	<br/>
			We are collaborating with researchers from UC Berkeley to design a large-scale evaluation of the Digital Green system and are piloting an interactive voice response system accessible by phone which supports the community members involved in our work.
    		<br/>	<br/>
    		The Digital Green <a class='quicklinks' href='/teammember'>team</a> has grown to nearly five-hundred people supporting our efforts on the ground.  Our eighteen core team members now work with seven partners across four states in India.  Eighty-one staff members of our partners run the Digital Green system with the four-hundred members of the community who create and distribute locally relevant videos on a day-to-day basis.  We have learned and shared much with one another and are gearing up for our second partners' meet and team retreat next month.   
    		<br/><br/>
    		Along the way, we have generated some buzz in the <a class='quicklinks' href='/press'>media</a>, garnered awards from MIT's Technology Review and Fortune Magazine, <a class='quicklinks' href='/media/paperdev2010.pdf' target='_blank'>published a paper on COCO</a> at the ACM Symposium on Computing for Development, and connected with networks like TED and Ashoka.  We even had the extraordinary opportunity to share Digital Green with <a class='quicklinks' href='http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2010/11/06/fact-sheet-expo-agriculture-and-food-security' target='_blank'>President Obama</a> during his recent visit to India. 
    		<br/><br/>
    		We are exploring collaboration possibilities with several civil, private, and public sector organizations to extend our work - geographically in India and Africa, in sectors like public health and skills development, and in forums of mass and social media to engage different audiences.  
			<br/><br/>
			We are excited by the progress that we've made so far and look forward to bringing about an even greater change.

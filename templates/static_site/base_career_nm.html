		The Strengthening Partnerships, Results and Innovations in Nutrition Globally (SPRING) Project is a United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded project which began October 1, 2011. It is implemented by five experienced and respected nutrition and public health organizations, including: JSI Research & Training Institute, Inc. (JSI), the managing partner; Helen Keller International (HKI); the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI); Save the Children (SC); and the Manoff Group (TMG). The main focus of SPRING is the reduction of anemia and stunting among women and young children through the expansion of effective social and behavior change communication (SBCC) and nutrition-sensitive programs aimed at promoting high impact maternal, infant and young child nutrition (MIYCN) practices. Under this mandate, SPRING has committed to identifying, adapting and testing highly promising SBCC tools and models in several priority countries. The first model to be tested is an innovative participatory video learning approach currently being used by Digital Green to promote the diffusion of improved agricultural practices in India. SPRING proposes to adapt and test this approach for nutrition in the Indian state of Orissa. High impact nutrition behaviors that will be promoted will be determined based on local priorities, but are likely to include exclusive breastfeeding, timely and appropriate complementary feeding, diversification of diets, micronutrient supplementation, household gardening, safe water and hygiene, among other topics. 
		<br/>
		<br/>
		SPRING's partner for this project, Digital Green, is an international, non-profit development organization that builds and deploys information and communication technology (ICT) to amplify the effectiveness of development efforts to affect sustained, social change. The Digital Green system combines technology and social organization to improve the cost-effectiveness and broaden the community participation in existing best practices. Digital Green is supported by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Department for International Development (DfiD), Ford Foundation, and Government of India. Digital Green's India country office is located in New Delhi with state offices in Bhopal, Bhubaneswar, Patna, Hyderabad and Bengaluru. It currently works in collaboration with local partners in seven states in India (Bihar, Jharkhand, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, and Karnataka), and is currently extending its operations to Ghana and Ethiopia, in Africa.
